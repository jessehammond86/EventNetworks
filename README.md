phoenixNet
=====

Download, munge, and transform Phoenix auto-coded event data to daily event-networks.

'phoenixNet' includes a small set of functions that download a specified range of daily
event files from the Phoenix data storage (http://phoenixdata.org/data/current), 
process the data to remove possible duplicate events, subset by actors to focus on
interactions between state governments, and convert the resulting data to a set of daily 
event-networks by event code or event root code.

Please note: this tool does not (currently) save the raw Phoenix daily files to disk.
If you are interested in acquiring and saving the raw data to plot or analyze as 
events rather than network ties, I suggest using the excellent `phoxy' package created
by [Andrew Halterman](https://github.com/ahalterman/phoxy) at Caerus Associates.

The current development of the Phoenix Data Project is a collaborative effort between 
Caerus Associates (Erin Simpson, Andrew Halterman, and John Beieler), Parus Analytics 
(Phil Schrodt), The University of Texas at Dallas (Patrick Brandt), The Cline Center 
for Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and The University 
of Oklahoma. Visit the Phoenix website here: [http://phoenixdata.org/](http://phoenixdata.org/)
and the website of the Open Event Data Alliance here: [http://openeventdata.org/](http://openeventdata.org).

`phoenixNet` is still in a very early stage of development, and is likely to change
significantly over time.

Installation
------------
`devtools::install_github("jrhammond/phoenixNet")`

Usage
-----

'phoenixNet' contains the following functions:

* 'phoenix_net' intakes a start date, end date, and event aggregation level
  as arguments, and outputs a list of dynamic network objects (tsna::networkDynamic). 
  Each dynamic network describes daily interactions along one CAMEO-coded event category
  or event root category between the 255 ISO-coded states in the international system. 
  These are directed, binarized (1/0) networks, in which a tie between two states i and j
  indicates that state i initiated at least one event of a given type towards state j.

* 'phoenix_stats' intakes a list of network objects generated by 'phoenix_net', and generates
  an array of network, dyad, and nodal statistics for each event-day-network in the input.
  The resulting object is a list of lists: layer (1) contains the event or root code,
  and layer (2) contains a set of tables containing statistics of interest organized
  by level of analysis and date.
  
Example:

```
> # Create a set of dynamic event-networks, one for each event root category
> data <- phoenix_net(start_date = 20140620, end_date = 20140622, level = 'rootcode')
